# Power-BI-showcase-I
# Power BI Data Visualization Project 1
This repository contains a demonstrating the fundamentals of data modeling and visualization using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**. The report is built from publicly available CSV datasets and showcases interactive dashboards, hierarchical categories and cross-visual filtering.

## 📄 Overview
In this project, I:
- Imported customer, product, and order data from external URLs.
- Built a data model with relationships between tables.
- Created hierarchies (e.g., Category → Product).
- Designed an interactive sales report with visualizations including:
  - Stacked column charts
  - Pie charts
  - Map visuals (by city)
  - Drill-down capabilities

The final output is a `.pbix` Power BI report file that can be opened and explored in **Power BI Desktop (Windows)**.
